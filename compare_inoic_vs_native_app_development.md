Take a Glance Ionic vs Native App Development Takeaways
			Native
1.	Languages required	HTML, CSS and JavaScript	Objective-C, Swift,C#, Java (android)
2.	Ability to work on other platforms	Ionic is able to run a single code on various platforms.	To run on another platform a new code is required to build from the scratch.
3.	UI and Themes	Ionic has a whole set of UI and Themes to select from.	The developer has to code UI as per the platform.
4.	Splashscreens and icons	A single Splashscreen works on all the devices and platforms.	For each device and screen size the developer has to create a unique Splashscreen.
5.	Styling/CSS	“Ionic creater” provides easy Styling and CSS just by drag and drop options.	Styling requires a unique coding to do the customization and design requirements.
6.	Performance	The apps are a little clingy and slow.	Native provides fastest and smoothest feel of the applications.
7.	Availability of plug-ins	Ionic has a wide range plug-ins, which makes the development phase faster.	Plug-ins are required to be coded so as a result take time for the development of the application.
8.	Cost of development	Developing an ionic application is affordable, as one ionic developer is capable enough to build an app that can run on any platform.	A fortune amount is required for each version of different operating system.
9.	Use of device features	An ionic app can utilize device features by using a third-party framework; Cordova.	A native application doesn’t require any third party platform or medium, it can directly use the device features.
10.	Technical abilities needed	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript	IOS-Swift, Objective-C, Android-Java, Windows-C#
11.	Graphics Performance	Not efficient with 3D Games and Graphics	Aesthetic and fast for Gaming purpose
12.	Reliability	Mostly dependent upon third-party plug-ins.	Very reliable because of structured code writing
