# Which Mobile App Developement Platform to choose ? (Inoic Vs Native)

If you want a faster loading native application all you need is enough budget and time to hire native app developers for separate platforms and then go with native application development, otherwise ionic framework is the best option for hybrid app development.


As ionic is just a framework of hybrid platform and native itself is a mobile application development platform, so no connection between them. Why only Ionic vs Native Apps Comparison? (And not other comparison). There are many of hybrid frameworks in the market but what is the reason behind choosing ionic vs native app development? The battle between hybrid apps and native apps is never ending. Both have their own majors and minors.

But do you know that ionic framework is the only framework of the hybrid platform that is actually giving a tough competition to the native applications in 2019?

Since the day it has launched to till now, ionic has gone through a major evolution.It has helped the hybrid platform to win over native app development. Especially, developers are in a big dilemma of choosing ionic between ionic vs native Apps

Below we will go through these two platforms and discuss briefly their advantages and disadvantages.
Therefore, you can use your resources accordingly to figure out between ionic vs native apps.

### What are the Key Difference - Ionic vs Native
Below we have given complete guidance for the selection of the best mobile app development technology for your need.
For that let’s first understand ionic framework

### What is Ionic Framework?
Ionic is an open source SDK (Software development kit), which is used in the design and development of hybrid mobile applications.
Prerequisites of developing these apps are having good command over HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Myriads of developers today have turned towards ionic framework due to its compatible features and functionality.

### Pros and Cons of Ionic Framework
For better understandability of native app vs ionic, let’s have a look at advantages and disadvantages of ionic framework.
 #### Advantages of Ionic Framework
- Open Source
- Availability of readily made plug-ins.
- Fixed number of programming languages.
- Programming can be easily mastered for ionic apps.
- The same code can be run on a different platform. E.g. iOS, Android, and Windows.

 #### Disadvantage of Ionic Framework
- The performance of the ionic applications is not up to the level as it would work when developed natively.
- It cannot provide security as native apps do.
- It doesn’t have plug-ins for every requirement, so it takes more time to develop separately new plug-ins.

Now, let’s go through what is native app development!

### What is Native app development?
Native apps are developed for specific platforms and particular devices.
As native applications are device specific, it has to be developed considering hardware and software. Native apps are built according to the functionality of the platforms.

For instance, An Apple’s iOS uses Swift and Objective-C languages to develop the applications while Android uses Java & Kotlin to develop native apps.

### Pros and Cons of Native Apps
If you want to learn more about the difference of ionic vs native apps you need to understand the pros and cons of native app development.
 #### Advantages of Native app
  - Since Native apps are written for the specific platform it can work very fast and efficiently on a particular platform.
  - The skilled programmer can develop it smoothly.
  - Easily available on the OS-specific app stores.
  - It requires approval from the app store, So the app developed on the native needs more security than the ionic framework.

 #### Disadvantages of Native app
  - It can be an expensive venture if the app, which is being made, has to be made for too many platforms.
  - The cost of the app maintenance becomes more if it is developed for different platforms.
  - The procedure of getting approval from the app store is quite cumbersome and a bit lengthy process.

The main reason for the large adoption of the hybrid platform is Ionic framework.
Selecting between Ionic app development and native app development process is not a tough choice now. As the people are aware of the pros and cons of both the platforms they know what to select and when to select.

### Take a Glance Ionic vs Native App Development Takeaways

|S.no | Characteristic | Ionic| Native |
| :---| :---      | :--- |:--- |
| 1.| Languages required|  	HTML, CSS and JavaScript|  	Objective-C, Swift,C#, Java (android)|
| 2.| Ability to work on other platforms|  	Ionic is able to run a single code on various platforms.|  	To run on another platform a new code is required to build from the scratch.|
| 3.| UI and Themes|  	Ionic has a whole set of UI and Themes to select from.|  	The developer has to code UI as per the platform.|
| 4.| Splashscreens and icons|  	A single Splashscreen works on all the devices and platforms.|  	For each device and screen size the developer has to create a unique Splashscreen.|
| 5.| Styling/CSS|  	“Ionic creater” provides easy Styling and CSS just by drag and drop options.|  	Styling requires a unique coding to do the customization and design requirements.|
| 6.| Performance|  	The apps are a little clingy and slow.|  Native provides fastest and smoothest feel of the applications.|
| 7.| Availability of plug-ins|  	Ionic has a wide range plug-ins, which makes the development phase faster.|  	Plug-ins are required to be coded so as a result take time for the development of the application.|
| 8.| Cost of development|  	Developing an ionic application is affordable, as one ionic developer is capable enough to build an app that can run on any platform.|  A fortune amount is required for each version of different operating system.|
| 9.| Use of device features|  	An ionic app can utilize device features by using a third-party framework; Cordova.|  A native application doesn’t require any third party platform or medium, it can directly use the device features.|
| 10.| Technical abilities needed|  	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript| IOS-Swift, Objective-C, Android-Java, Windows-C#|
| 11.| Graphics Performance|  	Not efficient with 3D Games and Graphics | Aesthetic and fast for Gaming purpose|
| 12.| Reliability|  	Mostly dependent upon third-party plug-ins.| Very reliable because of structured code writing|
