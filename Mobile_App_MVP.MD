#  Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
MVP for Startups is that adaptation of an original product which allows you to gather the huge amount of validated knowledge about consumers with the slightest efforts.
In simple term, MVP is the core of your future product. Basically, MVP product development incorporates only core features set, good UI/UX and standard design. It is created to demonstrate the product idea, examine the key assumption about interactions with it and determine customer reactions.
  Most common reason for this is they donâ€™t converse with the potential audience to recognize how much they are interested in the product. Direct releasing your final product would surely encounter such other risks.
  Thus, instead of releasing a full-featured mobile app you can opt for building an MVP App, which will significantly save you from future defeat by helping you to find out, what are the risks associated with your MVP App Development, at comparatively low cost.
