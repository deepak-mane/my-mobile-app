#  Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
MVP for Startups is that adaptation of an original product which allows you to gather the huge amount of validated knowledge about consumers with the slightest efforts.
In simple term, MVP is the core of your future product. Basically, MVP product development incorporates only core features set, good UI/UX and standard design. It is created to demonstrate the product idea, examine the key assumption about interactions with it and determine customer reactions.
