# My Mobile App

## Idea
train yourself to always think of things in terms of problems and potential solutions

## Strategy
->Initial Conversation
->Goal Definition
->Competitive Audit
->User Feedback
->Goal Review
->Output: Summarize into Report 
### 1.] identifying your competition
	#### Once you have an idea, you need to plan for your app’s success by identifying your competition. 
	Check to see if any other apps serve a similar purpose and look for the following
	- No. of installs - See if anyone is using these apps.
	- Ratings & Reviews - See if people like these apps and what they like/dislike about them.
	- Company history - See how these apps have changed over time and what sort of challenges they 
	faced along the way. Try to see what they did to grow their user base.
	*** Goal:
	1)Learn for free lessons from competitors
	2)To Understand how hard it will be to compete in marketplace

### 2.] Montetiztion
	### Several methods of monetization that could work, including: 
	- in-app purchases, 
	- subscription payments, 
	- premium features, 
	- ad-revenue, 
	- selling user data, and 
	- traditional paid apps.
	To determine which is best for your app, look to see what the market expects 
	to pay and how they expect to pay for similar services. You also need to consider 
	at what point you begin monetizing your app. Far too many apps (particularly startups)
	skip this step and have a hard time later turning a profit.

### 3.] Marketing
	#### Identifying the biggest challenges you will face when marketing your app. 
	Assuming you have a reliable app development and app design team, your biggest hurdles will 
	likely be driving app adoption

### 4.] Road Map (MVP)
	#### The final stage of the strategy process is defining your app’s roadmap. The goal of this process 
	is to understand what your app could one day become and what it needs to be successful on day one. 
	This day one version is often called your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). During this process, 
	it can be helpful to write on a whiteboard all of the things you want your app to do. Then 
	begin ranking these items by priority. Consider what your app's core functionality will be,
	what is needed to gain users, and what can be added later. If there are some features you 
	think users might want, they are likely great candidates for later versions. As you gain users
	with your MVP, you can solicit feedback on what additional features are desired. App monitoring 
	(covered later in this article) can also assist in this process.

### 1.] Information Architecture:
Information architecture is the process in which you decide what data and functionality needs 
to be presented within your app and how that data and functionality is organized. Typically, 
we begin this process by writing down a list of features we want the app to perform and a list 
of what needs to be displayed somewhere in the app. These are the basic building blocks with 
which we will build the wireframes.
- Tools we use: Whiteboards and Pencil & paper

### 2.] Wireframes 
Next, we begin creating screens and assigning each functions and data. It is ok if somethings 
live in multiple places, but you need to make sure each item has a home. This process often takes 
place on whiteboards or paper initially. You want to make changes here, rather than later in the 
process, because it is much cheaper to erase some marks than to rewrite code. Once you have several 
screens drawn up, begin considering your app’s workflows.

### 3.] Workflows
Workflows are the pathways users can travel within your app. Consider each of the things you want 
your users to be able to do and see how many clicks are needed to complete that action. Make sure 
each click is intuitive. If something takes a few clicks to accomplish, that might be fine, but it 
should not take a few clicks to perform common tasks. As you find problems with your workflows, 
update your wireframes and try again. Remember to run through all of your features in each iteration, 
just to make sure you did not increase the difficulty of one action in an attempt to improve another.

### 4.] Click-through models
Click-through models help you test your wireframes and workflows. They are basically a way to experience 
your wireframes on a phone for more realistic testing. For example, our clients simply receive a link, 
which when opened on their phone allows them to click through the wireframe. Although the app has 
no functionality at this point, they can click on each page in the app and begin testing the app’s 
navigation. As you find issues in this step, make changes with your wireframes and iterate until you 
are satisfied

->Design Framework
->Consistent Language
->Input/Feedback
->Iteration
=>Tappable UI Protoype

### 1.] Style guides
Style guides are basically the building blocks of your app’s design. By having a consistent design language, users are more likely to be comfortable within your app.You need to consider who you are and who your customers will be. Is your app going to be used at night? Then maybe a dark theme will work best, as to not blind your users. Will it be used mostly by busy employees? Try to keep clutter to a minimum and get your main point across. An experienced designer or design team has a wide range of output and can deliver an app that is a great fit for you and your customers. The output of this phase is a set of colors, fonts, and widgets (buttons, forms, labels, etc.) that will be drawn from in the design of your app.

### 2.] Rendered designs
Rendered design is the process of taking your wireframes and replacing the grayscale elements with elements from your style guide. There should be a rendered screen for each wireframe screen. Try to stay true to your style guide in this process, but you don’t have to be dogmatic about it. If you find yourself wanting a new or changed style, feel free to update or amend your style guides. Just make sure your design is consistent when this stage is complete.
