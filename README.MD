# My Mobile App
This mobile app development process typically includes idea, strategy, design, development, deployment, and post-launch phases.

## Idea
All great apps began as ideas. Train yourself to always think of things in terms of problems and potential solutions.  If you can identify a problem or market inefficiency, you are half way to your idea! The next thing to do is understand why this problem exists and think about why nobody else has made an app to solve this problem previously. Talk to others with this problem. Immerse yourself in the problem space as much as possible. Once you have a complete grasp of the problem, begin to evaluate how a mobile app could solve the problem.
This is where having some understanding of what mobile apps can do is extremely valuable. “Is this even possible?” Fortunately, the answer is often yes, but it is imperative that this answer is sound. You are about to invest a considerable amount of time and money into an app, now is the time to challenge your idea’s validity and viability.

## Strategy

->Goal Definition
->Competitive Audit
->User Feedback
->Goal Review
->Output: Summarize into Report 
### 1.] identifying your competition
	Once you have an idea, you need to plan for your app’s success by identifying your competition. 
	Check to see if any other apps serve a similar purpose and look for the following
	- No. of installs - See if anyone is using these apps.
	- Ratings & Reviews - See if people like these apps and what they like/dislike about them.
	- Company history - See how these apps have changed over time and what sort of challenges they 
	faced along the way. Try to see what they did to grow their user base.
	*** Goal:
	1)Learn for free lessons from competitors
	2)To Understand how hard it will be to compete in marketplace

### 2.] Montetiztion
	Several methods of monetization that could work, including: 
	- in-app purchases, 
	- subscription payments, 
	- premium features, 
	- ad-revenue, 
	- selling user data, and 
	- traditional paid apps.
	To determine which is best for your app, look to see what the market expects 
	to pay and how they expect to pay for similar services. You also need to consider 
	at what point you begin monetizing your app. Far too many apps (particularly startups)
	skip this step and have a hard time later turning a profit.

### 3.] Marketing
	Identifying the biggest challenges you will face when marketing your app. 
	Assuming you have a reliable app development and app design team, your biggest hurdles will 
	likely be driving app adoption

### 4.] Road Map (MVP)
	The final stage of the strategy process is defining your app’s roadmap. The goal of this process 
	is to understand what your app could one day become and what it needs to be successful on day one. 
	This day one version is often called your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). During this process, 
	it can be helpful to write on a whiteboard all of the things you want your app to do. Then 
	begin ranking these items by priority. Consider what your app's core functionality will be,
	what is needed to gain users, and what can be added later. If there are some features you 
	think users might want, they are likely great candidates for later versions. As you gain users
	with your MVP, you can solicit feedback on what additional features are desired. App monitoring 
	(covered later in this article) can also assist in this process.

### 1.] Information Architecture:
	Information architecture is the process in which you decide what data and functionality needs 
	to be presented within your app and how that data and functionality is organized. Typically, 
	we begin this process by writing down a list of features we want the app to perform and a list 
	of what needs to be displayed somewhere in the app. These are the basic building blocks with 
	which we will build the wireframes.

- Tools we use: Whiteboards and Pencil & paper

### 2.] Wireframes 
	Next, we begin creating screens and assigning each functions and data. It is ok if somethings 
	live in multiple places, but you need to make sure each item has a home. This process often takes 
	place on whiteboards or paper initially. You want to make changes here, rather than later in the 
	process, because it is much cheaper to erase some marks than to rewrite code. Once you have several 
	screens drawn up, begin considering your app’s workflows.

- Tools we use: Whiteboards, Pencil & paper, [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/), 
	and [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)

### 3.] Workflows
	Workflows are the pathways users can travel within your app. Consider each of the things 
	you want your users to be able to do and see how many clicks are needed to complete that 
	action. Make sure each click is intuitive. If something takes a few clicks to accomplish, 
	that might be fine, but it should not take a few clicks to perform common tasks. As you 
	find problems with your workflows, update your wireframes and try again. Remember to 
	run through all of your features in each iteration, just to make sure you did not increase 
	the difficulty of one action in an attempt to improve another.

- Tools we use: Whiteboards, Pencil & paper, [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/)

### 4.] Click-through models
	Click-through models help you test your wireframes and workflows. They are basically a way
	to experience your wireframes on a phone for more realistic testing. For example, our 
	clients simply receive a link, which when opened on their phone allows them to click through 
	the wireframe. Although the app has no functionality at this point, they can click on each 
	page in the app and begin testing the app’s navigation. As you find issues in this step,
	make changes with your wireframes and iterate until you are satisfied

## User-Interface Design
->Brand Integration
->Design Framework
->Consistent Language
->Input/Feedback
->Iteration
=>Output: Tappable UI Protoype

### 1.] Style guides
	Style guides are basically the building blocks of your app’s design. By having a consistent 
	design language, users are more likely to be comfortable within your app.You need to consider
	who you are and who your customers will be. Is your app going to be used at night? Then maybe
	a dark theme will work best, as to not blind your users. Will it be used mostly by busy 
	employees? Try to keep clutter to a minimum and get your main point across. An experienced
	designer or design team has a wide range of output and can deliver an app that is a great fit
	for you and your customers. The output of this phase is a set of colors, fonts, and widgets 
	(buttons, forms, labels, etc.) that will be drawn from in the design of your app.

### 2.] Rendered designs
	Rendered design is the process of taking your wireframes and replacing the grayscale elements
	with elements from your style guide. There should be a rendered screen for each wireframe
	screen. Try to stay true to your style guide in this process, but you don’t have to be 
	dogmatic about it. If you find yourself wanting a new or changed style, feel free to update
	or amend your style guides. Just make sure your design is consistent when this stage is complete.
- Tools we use: Whiteboards, Pencil & paper, and [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)

### 3.] Rendered Click-through models
	Once you have all your screens rendered, return to your click-through model application and
	test your app again. This is the step in the mobile app development process where you 
	really want to take your time. Although a considerable amount of effort has already gone 
	into the app, after this point changes can become increasingly costly. Think of this as 
	reviewing a floor plan before your home’s concrete is poured. Fortunately, mobile app 
	development is a bit more adaptive than construction, but thinking of it in these terms can 
	be the most cost-effective.

## Design-to-Development Handoff
After having put in so much effort into the form and function of your app, it is imperative that this vision is properly realized by your development team. It always amazes me how often this step in the mobile app development process goes poorly. Perhaps this is due to many organizations and agencies only providing design or development services or the sometimes combative relationship between designers and developers. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend finding a team that can provide both design and development services and can properly handle this step in the process.

Part of what helps ensure a smooth transition and exact implementation is the proper use of the available tools. We like using an application called Zeplin, which helps developers quickly grab style guides for the design. But, this is not foolproof. Zeppelin is a great tool, but sometimes its guides are not exact or not the best implementation (it can use explicit dimensions, rather than dynamic ones for example). In those situations, it is immensely beneficial if your developers can also use design applications (such as Sketch or Photoshop). The important thing here is that your team does not simply best guess at dimensions, hex values (colors), and positioning. Your design team put in tremendous effort to ensure things were properly aligned and positioned. Your development team’s goal should always be a pixel-perfect implementation.

## High-level Technical Design (Tech Stack)
There are numerous approaches, technologies, and programing languages that can be used to build a mobile app. Each with its own strengths and shortcomings. Some might be cheaper to use, but are less performant, whereas others might take longer to implement and be overkill. The worst possibility is building on a dying or unreliable technology stack. If you make this mistake, you might have to rebuild your app or pay a premium for developers moving forward. That is why having a trusted development partner that is seasoned in making these decisions is vital in this process.

### 1.] Front-end (the mobile app)
For front-end development, there are basically 3 approaches. They are platform-specific native, cross-platform native, and hybrid. Here is a brief overview of each approach and some articles that delve into each with greater details.

#### 1.1 ) Platform-specific Native 
	- Apps built with this approach are written separately for each mobile
	platform. Code can’t be reused between Android and iOS, but these apps can be fully optimized
	for each platform. The UI can look entirely native (so it will fit in with the OS) and the app
	should work fluidly. This is often the most expensive approach, but is very tried and tested.
#### 1.2 ) Cross-platform Native 
	- Apps built with this approach have some (or entirely shared) code, 
	but still run natively. Common technologies used for this are React Native, Xamarin, and 
	Native Script. This is a nice 	middle ground between the various approaches in that it is 
	more cost-effective, but can still be optimized and styled for each platform.
#### 1.3 ) Hybrid 
	- Hybrid apps are built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and are 
	installed via a native wrapper. This can be done using technologies such as Cordova, Phone Gap,
	and Ionic. This option can be the cheapest, but also presents some very real difficulties.

### 2.] Back-end (Web API & Server)
The server is responsible for much of your app’s performance and scalability. The technologies used here are similar to those used to power web-based applications. Here are a few things you have to decide before writing code:

#### 2.1 ) Language 
	- There are dozens of languages that can be used to build your API. Common languages used
	are Java, C#, Go-lang, javascript, PHP, and Python. Most languages also have numerous frameworks that
	can be utilized.
#### 2.2 ) Database 
	- There are two main types of modern databases. SQL and noSQL. SQL is more traditional 
	and the best choice in almost all cases. Common SQL implementations include MSSQL, MYSQL, and 
	PostgreSQL. In addition to selecting a database engine, you have to design your particular database 
	schema. Having reliable and well organized data is crucial to your long term success. So, make sure 
	this is well thought out.
#### 2.3 ) Hosting Environment (Infrastructure) 
	- In this step you need to decide where and how your API and 
	database will be hosted. Decisions made here will help determine the hosting costs, scalability, 
	performance, and reliability of your application. Common hosting providers include Amazon AWS and
	Rackspace. Beyond picking a provider, you need to plan how your system will scale as your user 
	base grows. Cloud-based solutions allow you to pay for resources as a utility and scale up and 
	down as needed. They also help with database backups, server uptime, and operating system updates.

## Development & Iteration
->Milestones
->Screens & Features
->Product Build
->Quality Assurance
->Iteration
=>Output: Working App

Sound mobile app development is an iterative process. You have likely heard the term “sprints” or “agile methodology”. This basically means that you break up all development work into smaller milestones and build your app in a series of cycles. Each cycle will include planning, development, testing, and review. There are entire books written on this process, so this article will just provide a brief overview of each step. If your company elects to use another process, these steps will be quite similar, but the order and length of each might vary.
	
### 1.) Planning 
	The planning phase of a sprint involves dividing up the list of tasks to be implemented 
	during the current iteration. Each task needs clearly defined requirements. Once these 
	requirements are  understood by developers, they will often estimate the time needed to 
	complete each task, so that the tasks can be evenly distributed to ensure a balanced 
	workload during the sprint. Developers also begin planning their approach to solving their
	assigned problems during this phase. 
	Skilled software developers find ways to intelligently reuse code throughout an 
	application. This  is especially important for implementing styles and shared functionality.
	If a design needs to be  changed (believe me, something will change), you don’t want to have
	to go and update code in numerous places. Instead, well designed software can be changed in 
	select places to make these sorts of sweeping changes.

### 2.) Development
	During the development phase your development team will begin implementing the styles and
	functionality of your app. As they are completed, they are assigned back to a project 
	manager or QA tester for review. Good project managers are able to fully optimize 
	developer workloads during this process by properly redistributing assignments 
	throughout the sprint.

	It is important that your development team fully understand the goals of the application
	as a whole and for the specific feature they are working on. Nobody is more in-tune with 
	that particular feature than the assigned developer. They should understand the intent 
	of the requirements. If something starts to not make sense, it is often developers who 
	will be the first to let you know.

	During development, we use a platform called Hockey App. It allows us to privately and
	securely distribute the in-development version of the app to testers, clients, and 
	other developers. Hockey  automatically notifies users of new builds (so everyone is 
	testing the latest & greatest), provides  crash reporting, and can ensure only approved
	testers have access to your app. It is a great way to keep everyone up to speed on 
	progress. During development, we try to update Hockey once or twice a week.

### 3.) Testing
	Most testing should be performed by non-developers or at least people who are not your 
	app’s primary 	developer. This will help ensure a more genuine testing experience. There 
	are several types of testing that should occur during each sprint. These typically include 
	the following:
	
 #### 3.1) Functional Testing 
	- Testing to ensure the feature works as described in the 
	requirements. 	Usually, a QA team will have a test plan with a list of actions and the 
	desired app behavior.
 #### 3.2) Usability Testing 
	- Testing to ensure the feature is user-friendly and is as 
	intuitive as possible. 	Often it is helpful to bring in new testers for a “first-use” 
	experience during this step.
 #### 3.3) Performance Testing 
	- Your app might work perfectly, but if it takes 20 seconds to 
	display a simple list, nobody is going to use it. Performance testing is typically more 
	important in later sprints, but keep an eye on the app’s responsiveness as you move along.
 #### 3.4) Fit and Finish Testing 
	- Just because the design phase is complete past, doesn't mean 
	you can  lock your designers in a closet. Designers should review each feature and ensure
	that their vision was implemented as described in the design. This is another reason why having
	one agency for both design and development is so beneficial.
 #### 3.5) Regression Testing 
	- Remember that one feature from the previous sprint? Don’t assume
	it still  works, just because you tested it last month. Good QA teams will have a list of
	tests to perform at the end of each sprint, which will include tests from previous sprints.
 #### 3.6) Device-Specific Testing 
	- There are tens of thousands of device and operating system
	combinations in the world. When testing, make sure you try out your app on numerous screen
	sizes and OS versions. There are tools that can help automate this, such as Google’s Firebase,
	but always test the app on at least a handful of physical devices.
 #### 3.7) User Acceptance Testing 
	- This is testing performed by either the app owner or future
	app users. Remember who you are building this app for and get their feedback throughout 
	the process. If a feature  passes all the above tests, but fails this one, what use is it?

	As problems are discovered in this phase, reassign tasks back to developers so that the
	problems can be  resolved and the issues closed out. Once testing has been completed and each
	task is done, move on to review.

## Review
At the end of each sprint talk with each of the stakeholders and determine how the sprint went. If there were difficulties, try to eliminate similar issues from future sprints. If things went well in one area, try to apply them elsewhere. No two projects are the exact same and everyone should always be advancing in their roles, so aim to improve, while you iterate. Once review is complete, begin again with the planning phase and repeat this process until the app is done!

## Extended Review
At this point your app should be fully testable and feature complete (at least for the MVP). Before you spend a sizable amount of time and money on marketing, take the time to test your app with a sample of your potential users. There are two main ways to go about this.

#### 1.) Focus Groups
	Focus groups involve conducting an interview with a tester or group of testers who have never 
	seen the app before and conduct an interview. You want to understand who these testers are, how they 
	learn about new apps, and if they use similar apps already. Try to get some background info out of them 
	before even getting into your product. Next, let your testers begin using your app. They should not 
	be coached during this process. Instead, let them use the app as if they had just found it in the app
	store. See how they use the app, and look for common frustrations. After they are done using the app,
	get their feedback. Remember to not be too strongly guided by any one tester, but combine feedback 
	and make intelligent decisions using all available feedback.

#### 2.) Beta Testing
	In addition to, or instead of focus groups, you can do a beta launch of your app. Beta tests involve
	getting a group of testers to user your app in the real world. They use the app just as if it had 
	launched, but in much smaller numbers. Often these beta testers will be power users, early adopters,
	and possibly your best customers. Make sure they feel valued and respected. Give them ample 
	opportunities to provide feedback and let them know when and how you are changing the app. Also, beta 
	testing is a great time to see 	how your app performs on various devices, locations, operating systems,
	and network conditions. It is imperative that you have sound crash reporting for this step. It does 
	you no good if something goes wrong, but is not discovered and diagnosed.

## Refinement
After these extended review periods, it is common to have a final development sprint to address any newly discovered issues. Continue beta testing during this process and ensure that your crash and issue reports are declining. Once you have the all-clear from your testers, it is time to begin preparing for deployment.

## Deployment
->App Stores & Web
->Store Standards
->Listed Marketing
->Listing Maintenance
=>Output: Downloadable App

There are two main components to deploying your mobile app into the world. The first involves deploying your web server (API) into a production environment that is scalable. The second is deploying your app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

#### 1.) Web API (Server)
	Most mobile apps require a server back-end to function. These web servers are responsible for 
	transferring data to and from the app. If your server is overloaded or stops working, the app will 
	stop working. Properly configured servers are scalable to meet your current and potential user base,
	while not being needlessly expensive. This is where the “cloud” comes in. If your server is deployed 
	to a scalable environment (Amazon Web Services, RackSpace, etc.), then it should be able to better 
	handle spikes in traffic. It is not terribly difficult to scale for most mobile apps, but you want 
	to ensure your team knows what they are doing or your app could fall apart, just when it gets popular.

#### 2.) App Stores
	Submitting your apps to the app stores is a moderately involved process. You need to make sure your
	apps are properly configured for release, fill out several forms for each store, submit screenshots
	and marketing materials, and write a description. Additionally, Apple manually reviews all apps 
	submitted to their app store. It is possible they will request you make changes to your app to better
	comply with their regulations. Often, you can discuss these changes with Apple and get them to accept
	your app as-is. Other times, you might have to make changes to be granted entrance. Once your app is
	submitted, it will be live in Google later that day and in Apple within a few days, assuming 
	everything goes smoothly.

## Monitoring
->Error Monitoring
->Performance Monitoring
->Metrics
->Tracking
->Packaged Information
=>Output: Reports

It would be incredibly naive to think that the mobile app development process ends when the app is shipped. Go look at any even moderately popular apps and you will see a long history of app updates. These updates include fixes, performance improvements, changes, and new features. Thorough monitoring is essential to best understand what sort of updates are needed. Here are a few things you should be monitoring.

#### 1.) Crashes
	There are numerous libraries that can be used to reliably track app crashes. These libraries include
	information about what the user was doing, what device they were on, and plenty of technical info 
	that is crucial for your development team in resolving the problem. Apps can be configured to 
	send an email/text/alert when crashes occur. These crashes can be viewed and triaged accordingly.
	
- Tools we use: [Sentry](https://www.sentry.com/) and [HockeyApp](https://www.hockeyapp.net/)

#### 2.) Analytics
	Modern app analytics systems are are treasure trove of information. They can help you understand
	who is using your apps (age, gender, location, language, etc.) and how they are using it (time of
	day, time spent in app, screens viewed in app, etc.). Some even allow you to view heat maps of 
	your app, so you know what buttons on each screen are clicked most often. These systems provide 
	an invaluable glimpse into how your app is being used. Use this information to best understand 
	where to invest future efforts. Don’t build onto portions of the app that are seldom utilized, 
	but invest where there is action and the largest potential for growth.

- Tools we use: [Facebook Analytics](https://analytics.facebook.com/), 
	[Apptentive](https://www.apptentive.com/), 
	[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/), and 
	[Appsee](https://www.appsee.com/)

#### 3.) Performance
	One vital metric not covered by the previous two monitoring categories is your apps technical
	performance, i.e. how quickly it works. Any system we deploy has extensive performance 
	monitoring in place. We are able to track how many times an action occurred and how long that
	action took. We use this to find areas ripe for optimization. We also put alerts in place to 
	let us know if a particular action is slower than expected, so we can quickly look to see if 
	there are any issues. These performance tools typically have dash-boarding, reporting, and 
	alerting functionality included.
 
- Tools we use: [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
 
#### 4.) App Store Management
	App store ratings and reviews are extremely important, particularly for newer apps. Whenever 
	a new review is left on your listing, make sure to engage the reviewer. Thank users who give 
	you great reviews and try to assist those who were frustrated. I have seen hundreds of poor 
	reviews changed to 5-stars just with a little customer service. Users don’t expect app 
	developers and owners to provide a hands-on level of service and that help goes a long way 
	in boosting your online reputation.
 
## Further Iteration and Improvement
The purpose of all this monitoring is to know what you need to do next. Most apps are never really done. There are always new features that can be added and things that can be improved upon. It would be incredibly wasteful to blindly build on your app. Use the information you have received from your users and your monitoring platforms. Then repeat parts of this mobile app development process (don’t worry, many steps are much easier each after the first pass). Continue to improve your app, your conversion rates, your install base, and of course your revenue. Mobile apps are fluid. Take advantage of that by continuing to grow and improve.

## Conclusion
The mobile app development process might seem overwhelming and involved. There are a lot of steps and difficult decision making is required along the way. But, it is an extremely rewarding process and can be quite lucrative. Also, there might be some temptation to skips steps in this process, but this guide is built upon years of experience working with app owners that chose to skip certain steps.
